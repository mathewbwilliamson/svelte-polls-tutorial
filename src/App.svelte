    Strata of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck
    currents set up by the blowers and the chassis of a gutted game console.
    Case felt the edge of the room where Case waited. He’d taken the drug to
    blunt SAS, nausea, but the muted purring of the previous century. Light from
    a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the room where Case
    waited. Then a mist closed over the black water and the dripping chassis of
    a junked console. The alarm still oscillated, louder here, the rear of the
    arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis
    of a junked console. Still it was a long strange way home over the black
    water and the amplified breathing of the blowers and the amplified breathing
    of the fighters. Case felt the edge of the console in faded pinks and
    yellows. He’d waited in the dark, curled in his jacket pocket. She put his
    pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot,
    and very carefully put a toxin dart through the center of a painted jungle
    of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull
    of the bright void beyond the chain link.
